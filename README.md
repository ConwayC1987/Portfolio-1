## 1. Requirements

- In this project, I need to build a static front-end site to present useful information to users, using all the technologies that I have learned about so far.
- The goal of the site is to provide a reliable source of information pertaining to the history of a particular artefact, person, place or event.
- Technologies required are HTML and CSS.
- Website needs a timeline of the subject material, evidence-based information and images/video supporting the facts.

## 2. Newgrange the website

This website was is all about Newgrange it provides the user with information of the history of Newgrange, what makes it so special, with an image gallery and a page with details on how to enter a draw for a chance to be in Newgrange for the Winter Solstice. The website is fully responsive on all devices and descripts how Newgrange was made and when, a video is also provided if the user wanted to learn more.

## 4. Features Used

![Navbar](/assets/images/navbar.jpg "Navbar image from the website")
- The navbar is a key feature without the site and is same layout on all pages making an easy user experience.
- The site logo is on the left hand side of the navbar and is also a clickable link to bring the user back to the home page and will change colour to let the user know what page they are on.
- The navbar on the left has three clickable links to different pages on the website that will change colour when clicked.
- When the screen size goes down the navbar will stack on top of eachother and center themselves in the screen.
- The navbar means the user will not have to click back as everything is accessible from the navbar. 
- The colour scheme is kept through out the website, representing the Irish flag colours.
- The logo on the navbar was styled to stand out to the rest of the text.

## 5. Troubleshooting
I had a problem with the index/home page when the screen size was reduced, the footer was staying in the middle of screen the problem was something really simple but took days to solve. Solution was getting rid of the height measurement from the div the above the footer.

### I used lighthouse on all the pages on the site and resolved most issues found in the report. 

### - This is the lighthouse report from the index/home page.

## 6. What I would add or change if I could

If I had the time I would introduce a map feature with the site location and blog or comments section from people's experience of going to Newgrange. I would of also liked to make the website more interactive for the users by using some javascript. Although I am very happy with my navbar, I would consider changing the navbar to a burger menu but I think my navbar suits the requirements of the project.
