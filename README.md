- The navbar on the right has three clickable links to different pages on the website that will change colour when clicked. When the user hovers over the link the colour changes so the user knows what page they are selecting.
- When the screen size goes down the navbar will stack on top of eachother and center themselves in the screen.
- The navbar means the user will not have to click back as everything is accessible from the navbar.

# Bugs and Unfixed Bugs
## Fixed
A bug with the index/home page when the screen size was reduced, the footer was staying in the middle of screen the problem was something really simple but took days to solve. Solution was getting rid of the height measurement from the div the above the footer.
![Problem with the footer](/assets/images/footer-problem.jpg "Footer stuck in the middle of the screen")
## Unfixed Bugs
There was a bug on the history page because of the video used from youtube that lighthouse report showed up "Some third-party embeds can be lazy loaded. Consider replacing them with a facade until they are required." and "Consider marking your touch and wheel event listeners as passive to improve your page's scroll performance.".
- The two bugs brings down my best practise score and are still unfixed
